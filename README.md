# for our CIM group at HKU, as junior portfolio managers
Have some fun making some algos~

Our approach:
1. Think of strategies, pull data from Futu / other APIs, backtest using python, and potentially deploy
2. If it works, we'll transfer our code to C++ or Clojure, since its quicker


Main Strategies:
1. Looking into long-term fundamentals (2 years and above)
2. Trading short-term technicals (MACD, etc.)
3. Anything that has good alpha. No HFT.
