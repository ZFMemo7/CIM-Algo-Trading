Current work:
1. Outline comparable companies within an industry (size, financials, region, busines model, etc)
2. Pull their EV and EBITDA values every 6 month
3. Apply the average or median (may depend on a skewness test, potentially)
4. If company's multiple < avg multiple, then undervalued, otherwise, overvalued
5. Conduct trade, rebalance portfolio every 6 months
